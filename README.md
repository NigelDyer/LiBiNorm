# LiBiNorm
This repository holds the source code for the LiBiNorm application.

LiBiNorm has been designed to perform gene expression analysis using RNA-seq data. It is command line and output compatible with htseq-count and also includes RNA-seq bias compensation tailored to library preparation as described in the paper: Modeling enzyme processivity reveals that RNA-Seq libraries are biased in characteristic and correctable ways

LiBiNorm is a command line program that can be built using gcc on Linux, AppleOS or cygwin and the Makefile LiBiNorm/Makefile. make release/debug and clean are supported.

It can also be built using Microsoft Visual studio 2015 or later and the solution file LiBiNorm/LiBiNorm.sln
